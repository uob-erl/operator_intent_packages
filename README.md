# Bayesian-Based-Human-Operator-Intent-Recognition

The package contains files associated with hierarchical Mixed-Itiative controller. The experiment attempted to investigate human intent recongition while human-operators were assigned to remotely control a mobile robot in multiple Search & Rescue scenarios. A Bayesian-Based framework is adopted to perform intent recognition (i.e. most probable goal that human wants to progress the robot towards) based on environmental data (e.g. path length, angle) gathered by the mobile robot on-the-fly.
